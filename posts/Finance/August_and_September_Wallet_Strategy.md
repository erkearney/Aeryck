#Credit Card Strategy Review: August and September

New month(s),new wallet strategy review. My strategy for August and September was identical to June and July (read [here](https://aeryck.com/post:3) for more on that. Here's the tl;dr though:

* Gas, Groceries, Restaurants -> American Express Platinum for 5 points per dollar
* Miscellaneous (Target, movies, places where my chosen card wasn't accepted, etc.) -> Discover IT, US Bank card, Costco card, Amazon card, or Citi Double Cash
* Everything else -> Hilton Honors card for 3 Hilton points per dollar and to meet the welcome bonus
* Everything else once the welcome bonus on the Hilton Honors card has been met -> Hilton Honors Surpass card for 3 Hilton points per dollar\*

* American Express Membership rewards points are valued at 1.1 cents per point
* Hilton Honors points are valued at 0.5 cents per point

Let's start, as always, with the annual fees of my credit card setup and if/how those fees with offset with any credits I was able to use.

##Fees
* American Express Platinum (x2) -> $695/year, ~$57.92/month
* Hilton Honors Surpass -> $95/year, ~$7.92/month

##Credits
* American Express Digital Entertainment Credit: (Disney+ $8.62, Hulu $20)/month
* Uber credit: $30/month

* **Effective fee after credits: $65.13/month**

##Spend breakdown
Now for the fun part: How much I spent on each card:

Spend on American Express Platinum (Gas, Groceries, Restaurants, Hotels):
    - August: $511.77
    - September: $1335.19

#Points earned: 16,019; Value at 1.1 cents per point: $176.21; Percent back: 4.15%
#
#Spend on Miscellaneous cards (Discover, Citi Doublecash, Costco, Amazon, and US Bank): $603.68 (See the June Review for more info on these cards)
#Cash back: $27.30; Percent back: 4.52%
#
#
#Spend on Hilton Honors cards: $1391.99
#Points earned: 103,426\*; Value at 0.5 cents per point: $517.13; Percent back: 37.15%
#
#######\* This is with the 100,000 point sign-up bonus on the Hilton Honors card that I met this month, without it the numbers would be: Points earned: 3,426; Value at 0.5 cents per point: $17.13; Percent back: 1.23%
#
#**Total Spend: $6244.82**
#**Cash Value back: $720.64; Percent back: 11.54%**
#**Total Value accounting for credits and fees: $845.50; Percent back: 13.54%**
#
#**Total Value accounting for credits and fees, less sign-up bonus from Hilton Honors card: $345.50; Percent back: 5.53%**
#
#
###Conclusion
#My August strategy netted me 11.54% back. A slightly amusing/obnoxious take would be to say that my use of credit cards negated the [impact of inflation](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/inflation-cpi) on me. Obviously the fact that I got a hefty sign-up bonus inflated the numbers quite a bit, but I'm very pleased that even factoring that bonus out I managed to surpass my goal of >5% back overall, although this still was inflated by the fact that I got the $200 hotel credit benefit last month. For the month of August I don't plan on pursuing any new sign-up bonuses or being able to utilize a large credit from American Express, so I would expect my return to drop back down to around 4.5%.
