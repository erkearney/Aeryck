####My name is Eric Kearney.

I'm a Software Engineer. Right now I'm employed as a Test Engineer and a debugger. I'm working on my Master's degree in Data Science and Machine Learning at Colorado State University. I created this website to serve as a home for my Resume, Blog, and personal projects.

I built aeryck.com in [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/) with Jinja templates, and just a little bit of css. It's using a simple sqlite database in the backend, and it's deployed using [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/) and [gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/). I wrote this website to reflect my own personal values in software; I believe that code should be kept as clean and simple as possible. If it's of interest to you, feel free to take a look at this website's code on [my github](https://github.com/erkearney/Aeryck).

If you're interested in working with me, please reach out at [erickearney@protonmail.com](mailto:erickearney@protonmail.com). If you have a spare few moments, consider checking out some of my friends' websites. [Ryan](https://ryansinner.art/) (who made the Aeryck logo) and [Christopher](https://www.autodidacticpantologist.org/). Thanks!
