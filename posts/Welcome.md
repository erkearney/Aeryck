My name is Eric Kearney.

I'm a Software Engineer. I'm working on my Master's degree in Data Science and
Machine Learning at Colorado State University. I created this website to serve
as a home for my Resume, Blog, and personal projects.

I built aeryck.com in [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/). It's
using a simple sqlite database in the backend, and it's deployed using
[nginx](https://nginx.org/en/) and [gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/). If it's of
interest to you, feel free to take a look at this website's code on
[my github](https://github.com/erkearney/Aeryck).

I also write tutorials covering topics such as programming, data visualization,
probability and statistics, and machine learning. My tutorials are written with
a "bottom-up" approach; emphasizing mastering the basics and gradually building
upon them, with the aim to 'self-discover' the more complex concepts.
